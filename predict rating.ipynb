Parking for this place is a little rough because it's in a relatively high traffic part of NoHo, but there's metered parking along the street. Inside the place is well decorated and air conditioned. The staff was friendly and helpful, they made an effort to make sure that I felt like I had a good experience. Great customer service and the recommendations seemed like they weren't trying to bullshit me and tell me 'everything we sell is potent.' They have a big selection of buds, edibles and a moderate selection of concentrates. Prices weren't cheap but they weren't a rip off either; if you're trying to get an ounce for 100 dollars don't bother coming here. I think the cost justified the price of the stuff they had.

       "54931   I just moved to the area and I was on the hunt for a top shelf collective to get my meds. Parking for this place is a little rough because it's in a relatively high traffic part of NoHo, but there's metered parking along the street. Inside the place is well decorated and air conditioned. The staff was friendly and helpful, they made an effort to make sure that I felt like I had a good experience. Great customer service and the recommendations seemed like they weren't trying to bullshit me and tell me 'everything we sell is potent.' They have a big selection of buds, edibles and a moderate selection of concentrates. Prices weren't cheap but they weren't a rip off either; if you're trying to get an ounce for 100 dollars don't bother coming here. I think the cost justified the price of the stuff they had. Wil be returning regularly.                                                                                                              \n",

       "93776   this is one of the best im thinking maybe even the best delivery in the area. the guys who deliver are all super nice and i never wait too long so thats a big plus. and the prices i think are fair for how potent the meds are. so getting to the point i was blown away by this service last time i ordered and had to leave a review when someone really is on top of the game like sac confidential. i like good buds and these guys have them talking those nice dense hyrdo buds but more and more im turning into a wax and shatter dabber as they call em not even smoking weed as much. i love the strong concentrates and especially shatter because thats the best tasting and pure. that evolution shatter you all had blew me away for real i never tried anything like that before and i go out to oakland sometimes for meds so that says something. very happy patient here not one bad thing to say about this service the others guys could learn something haha    \n",
